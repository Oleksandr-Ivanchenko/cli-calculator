## 🧮 CLI Calculator

A lightweight command-line calculator built with Node.js. Supports basic arithmetic operations via terminal arguments.

### 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cli-calculator.git
cd cli-calculator
npm install


### ⚙️ Usage

```bash
node main.js <operation> <num1> <num2>
```

#### Examples

```bash
node main.js add 100 500        # → 600
node main.js subtract 100 50    # → 50
node main.js multiply 7 6       # → 42
node main.js divide 10 2        # → 5
```

### ✅ Supported Operations

| Operation   | Command     | Description                  |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Addition    | `add`       | Adds two numbers             |
| Subtraction | `subtract`  | Subtracts second from first  |
| Multiplication | `multiply` | Multiplies two numbers     |
| Division    | `divide`    | Divides first by second      |

### 🛠 Notes

- All arguments must be valid numbers.
- Division by zero throws an error.
- Each operation is modularized for clarity and scalability.

### 📌 Roadmap

- [ ] Support for multiple operands (`add 1 2 3 4`)
- [ ] Expression parsing (`(2 + 3) * 4`)
- [ ] Help flag (`--help` or `-h`)
- [ ] CLI alias via `bin` in `package.json`
